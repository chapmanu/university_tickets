After a spectacular escape from an FBI prisoner convoy, the most notorious, wanted drug kingpin in the hemisphere is hurtling toward the border at 200 mph in a specially outfitted car with a hostage and a fierce army of gang members. He is headed, it turns out, straight for Summerton Junction, where the whole of U.S. law enforcement will have their last opportunity to make a stand and intercept him before he slips across the border forever. At first reluctant to become involved, and then counted out because of the perceived ineptitude of his small town force, Owens ultimately accepts responsibility for the face off.</span></span></span></p>",

Even Happiness, his dog, has run away from him. Lovelorn, self-destructive and desperately aimless, San Bao nevertheless has moments of euphoria amid his own despair, as he roams the sleek, shifting city with other soulful, cash-poor dreamers and misfits. Such heavenly losers form the vital spirit of Beijing in acclaimed director Zhang Yuan&rsquo;s gorgeously gritty, angst-ridden portrait of youthful disaffection and perseverance in the teeth of heartbreak, ruthless inequality and unfeeling ambition. </span></span></span></span></p>",

She remembers a boy she knew half a century before. Moving to a peaceful village when she was a girl she discovered a &ldquo;wolf boy,&rdquo; hiding his large, contorted body in the darkness. The girl, now a woman, has never been able to purge the images of his wild eyes and animal-like behavior from her mind. She recalls teaching the boy how to wait patiently before a meal, how to wear clothes, how to speak, how to write and other human behaviors so that he could one day live like a normal man. She opened her heart to the innocent boy and he fell in love with the girl, the only person to ever show him affection. However when threatened, he let loose his bestial instincts and became the subject of the villagers&rsquo; fears. In order to save the life of the boy who risked his to be by her side, she left him with a promise: &ldquo;Wait for me. I&rsquo;ll come back for you.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>",

Following their 2006 debut in Carnegie Recital Hall, New York Concert Review called them &ldquo;powerhouse performers,&rdquo; noting Mary&rsquo;s &ldquo;warm and brilliant&rdquo; sound and Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;thought- provoking&rdquo; and &ldquo;atmospheric&rdquo; playing. They have since commissioned or premiered nearly two-dozen works from such esteemed composers as David Rakowski, Frederic Rzewski, Gabriela Frank, and Forrest Pierce, as well as numerous works by emerging composers. DuoSolo appears regularly on concert series around the world and are frequent guests at new music festivals around the U.S.</p> <p>DuoSolo creates programs that include music for solo &#64258;ute, solo piano, and &#64258;ute/piano duo, ranging from twentieth- century masterpieces to contemporary explorations of rock, pop, electronic music, and performance art. In 2008, DuoSolo created the DuoSolo Foundation: a 501(c)(3) nonpro&#64257;t organization dedicated to the commissioning, performance, and education of new music. Annually, the DuoSolo Foundation sponsors an Emerging Composer Competition and new-music recitals bene&#64257;ting causes including disaster relief, environmental protection, and animal rights.&nbsp; Under the auspices of the DuoSolo Foundation, Mary and Michael also direct the Cortona Sessions for New Music in Cortona, Italy. The Cortona Sessions brings young composers and performers together to encourage future collaborations and performances of new music through two weeks of rehearsals, lectures, workshops, and recitals. In two seasons, the Cortona Sessions has supported the premiere of more than eighty new works.</p>",

Isherwood has worked closely with composers such as Sylvano Bussotti, Elliott Carter, George Crumb. Hans Werner Henze, Mauricio Kagel, Gy&ouml;rgy Kurt&aacute;g, Steve Lacy, Olivier Messiaen, Giacinto Scelsi and &nbsp;Iannis Xenakis.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.nicholasisherwood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more...</a></p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About Mark Robson:</span><br />Mark Robson has been hailed by the Los Angeles Times as a pianist with &ldquo;one of the great techniques,&rdquo; &ldquo;an inquiring mind&rdquo; and a performer capable of evoking an &ldquo;exquisite engulfing pastel haze,&rdquo; and he continues to impress with his multi-faceted career as a soloist, chamber musician, and teacher. Mr. Robson is equally comfortable in styles ranging from early music played on the harpsichord and organ to the great Romantic repertoire and beyond to contemporary piano works demanding theatrical participation from the performer. As a collaborative artist with singers and instrumentalists, he commands the respect of his peers in both the recital and chamber settings. He presents an annual recital for the LA series <em>Piano Spheres</em> and has performed for <em>Jacaranda</em> on numerous occasions. As an organist, he has also appeared as a soloist in the Minimalist Jukebox at Disney Hall and has performed on the organ in Mahler&rsquo;s 8th Symphony at the Hollywood Bowl in their 2008 season.</p>",
